Go is steadily becoming one of the most popular programming languages, and more and more organizations are now using Go to write services. Many Python developers now find themselves having to transition to Go, and in this course, Miki Tebeka helps Python developers make the switch to get started writing Go programs. Miki covers the basics, from built-in types to function definitions, and gets into concurrency and project engineering as well. He also provides challenges and solutions for each chapter, so you can practice your skills as you learn. If youâ€™re a Python developer looking for some hands-on experience as you transition to Go, join Miki in this course.
